# Penn Brain Science Center Cluster Computing Resources

This is the index page for the [Penn Brain Science
Center](https://pennbrain.upenn.edu) cluster computing documentation. 

The BSC computing cluster is hosted by DART (formerly PMACS) in their "Limited
Performance Computing" (LPC) environment.

# LPC overview

The LPC is a shared resource for cluster computing, supported by DART and the
BSC. It replaces the CFN cluster. 

## LPC accounts

How to get an LPC account.

## LPC vs CFN cluster usage

Main article: [LSF for CFN users](/docs/clusterEnvironment/cfnToLSF.md)

The LPC cluster uses the IBM LSF system for parallel computing, while the CFN
cluster used the Sun Grid Engine. While many of the same concepts apply, there
are several differences in how jobs are submitted and run.
