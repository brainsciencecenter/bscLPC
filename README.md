# BSC LPC Documentation

This repo hosts the code for the BSC LPC documentation.

The site code and theme is based on [Just The
Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) v0.3.3 (tag 0.3.3 from
Github, but code seems to reference 0.3.2).

Information below is a quick guide to writing doc pages in Markdown.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/brainsciencecenter/bscLPC/edit/gh-pages/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brainsciencecenter/bscLPC/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
