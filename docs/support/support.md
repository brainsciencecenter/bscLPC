# Troubleshooting

## If you can't connect

## Ensure you are logged in to the correct node

There are three access points at {node}.pmacs.upenn.edu, where {node} is

* transfer - no shell access, scp / sftp only for uploading or downloading data.
* sciget - shell access + Internet, git, other data transfer.
* scisub - job submission. bsub, ibash, xbash, only work from here.

None of these login nodes should be used for computationally intensive jobs, and
most of the data processing software is unavailable on these machines. To run
something like FSL or FreeSurfer interactively, request a compute slot with
ibash or xbash.
